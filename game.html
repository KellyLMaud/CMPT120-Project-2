    <h1>Survival</h1>
    <h2>by Kelly Maud</h2>
    <textarea rows="10" cols="60" id="tagame"> 
    You were on a biplane going site seeing in the Colorado Mountains when the pilot had a seizure and the plane went down. 
    You survive the plane crash with a broken hand but the pilot and the two other passengers do not. 
    In order to survive you must splint your arm and set up camp for the night... there is a field north of you and a stream to the east. To the west is a forest and to the south is where the plane crashed.  
    In the field north of you there is wild animals, such as rabbits and mice, and there is also vegitation.
    The stream east of you may have some salmon you can fish for.
    In the forest there are plenty of sturdy branches.
    The plane crash may have a first aid kit or other useful things... go check it out.
